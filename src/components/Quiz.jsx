// But now you will notice as your selected button changes color=>it jumps around.
//This is because we are using a state to help change color.Hence as state makes comp re-render.The options gets shuffled at every re-render.
//Hence your chosen option jumps around as it changes color.
//Therefore, time to split the Quiz code to solve this problem.
