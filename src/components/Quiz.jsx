// But now you will notice => the application is behaving weirdly. The=is is because you have used same key on both component. 
//Key should be unique.
// Also   <Answers> and <QuestionTimer> are sibling. They have same parent.Another reason for them to not have same key.
//Solution 1-
// <Answers  key={activeQuestionIndex+1} .../>
//<QuestionTimer key={activeQuestionIndex} .../>
// solution 2-
//   only parent div willl have key prop and not answers or QuestionTimer component  <div id="question"  key={activeQuestionIndex}>
//Solution 3- Max's solution (part-77)
//Make another component that will have  <Answers> and <QuestionTimer> component and it will have key prop.
//I think this is preferd bcoz in react we should make as many component as much as possible and now we will use one single key on QuestionComponent
